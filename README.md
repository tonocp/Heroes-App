# MEAN CRUD SuperHeroes App

This is the GitHub repository for this **MEAN CRUD** project I made using **Angular**, **Angular Material** for *Create, Read, Update and Delete* Super Heroes from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) Database.

Right now it can *CRUD* through the database correctly, it also check the image URL and set an image by *default* if you don't provide an URL.

It also implements **User Authentication** using *'CanLoad'* and *'CanActivate'* from the *'@angular/router'* module, and saving a **JSON WEB TOKEN** in a *Session Variable*. Besides, it also show the user name and can *logout* correctly, routing the user to the *Login Page*.

Right now is **still on development** and isn't deployed.

<!-- **Now it's deployed here https://heroes-app-tcp.netlify.app/** -->
