# HeroesApp

This is the GitHub repository for this CRUD project I made using **Angular**, **Angular Material** and **JSON Server** for *Create, Read, Update and Delete* Super Heroes from a JSON Database.

Right now it can *CRUD* through the database correctly, it also check the image URL and set an image by *default* if you don't provide an URL.

It also implements **User Authentication** using *CanLoad* and *CanActivate* from the *@angular/router* module, and saving the User ID in a *session variable* called 'token'. Besides, it also show the user name and can *logout* correctly, routing the user to the *Login Page*.

Right now is **still on development** and isn't deployed.

<!-- **Now it's deployed here https://heroes-app-tcp.netlify.app/** -->
