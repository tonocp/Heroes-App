# MEAN CRUD SuperHeroes App

This is the GitHub repository for this **MEAN CRUD** project I made using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for *Create, Read, Update and Delete* Super Heroes from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) Database.

It can *CRUD* through the database correctly, it also check the image URL and set an image by *default* if you don't provide an URL.

It also implements **User Authentication** using *'CanLoad'* and *'CanActivate'* from the *'@angular/router'* module, and saving a **JSON WEB TOKEN** in a *Local Storage Variable*. Besides, it also show the user name and can *logout* correctly, routing the user to the *Login Page*.

### Now it's deployed here https://crud-heroes.herokuapp.com/
