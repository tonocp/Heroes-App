# HeroesApp

This is the GitHub repository for this CRUD project I made using **Angular**, **Angular Material** and **JSON Server** for *Create, Read, Update and Delete* Super Heroes from a JSON Database.

Right now is **still on development** and isn't deployed.

<!-- **Now it's deployed here https://heroes-app-tcp.netlify.app/** -->
